# hello-world
This is a new repository created to learn how to use GitHub.

Hi Everyone! My name is Keith. I am simply learning a bit about github and its features.
I'm a musician at heart but I find programming to be another form of creation that fascinates me. 
I am hoping with time that I can combine my love for music and my new found interest in programming.
