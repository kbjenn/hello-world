# hello-world
This is a new repository created to learn how to use GitHub.

Hi Everyone! My name is Keith. I am taking the course CS50, the free course on the fundamentals of computer science. 
This is why I have set up this GitHub so that I can submit work. 
I'm a musician at heart but I find programming to be another form of creation that fascinates me. 
I am hoping with time that I can combine my love for music and my new found interest in programming.
